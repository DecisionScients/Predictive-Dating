# Case: Predictive Dating
Congratulations on getting a job as a data scientist at SpeedDating.com, the dominate player in the speed dating market! Your boss has compiled data from a series of past speed dating events and she asks you to:  
1. develop a model to predict whether a participant requests a second date,  
2. determine which attributes, or combinations thereof, are most highly associated with a second date decision, and      
3. present interesting insights about speed dating.

Not interested in a 'blackbox' solution, she advises that the model must make sense to the domain experts in marketing. You are also expected to describe your model selection process, justify your model choice, and explain how the model works.

## The Data 
The data was obtained from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004.  During these events, participants would have a series of four-minute “first-dates” with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of each four-minute date, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again.  Participants were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition, and shared interests. Additional information was obtained throughout the process such as demographics, lifestyle information and beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate. The training set is comprised of 5,925 observations or 'first dates'.

In this case, we will consider the following (`r kfigr::figr(label = "data", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Table")`) demographic, self-assessment, partner-assessment and preference data to predict the decision to request a second date.

`r kfigr::figr(label = "data", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Table")`: Speed dating data
```{r codebook}
filepath <- "./references/codebook.csv"
codebook <- read.csv(filepath)
vars <- codebook %>% filter(Blog == 'yes') %>% select(-Blog)
knitr::kable(vars) %>%  
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = T, position = "center")
```

## Data Analysis
```{python get_data_module, code=readLines("../src/data/blog.py")[28:90]}
```

```{python eda_data}
df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(
    directories.INTERIM_DATA_DIR, filenames.TRAIN_FILENAME))
rows = df.shape[0]
```

Your intern has extracted the complete cases, split the data into a training and test set, and conducted an exploratory data analysis on the `r py$rows` training observations. Let's review the highlights.

**#1) Approximately 4 out of 10 second dates.**
```{python gnd}
female = df[df['gender'] == 'female'].shape[0]
yes = df[df['decision'] == 'yes'].shape[0]
dg = df[['gender', 'decision']]
fig = visual.multi_countplot(dg, nrows=1, ncols=2, title='Gender and Decision Counts')
fig.savefig("./reports/figures/gnd.png")
plt.close(fig)
```

Each observation reflects an encounter of a single individual. Since the data were randomly sampled from complete cases, the number of observations for males does not match that for females. That said, of the `r py$rows` speed dates, `r py$yes` requested second dates.

`r kfigr::figr(label = "gnd", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")`: Gender and Decisions

**#2) Female participants 10% more selective than male counterparts**

```{python decisions_gender}
dg = pd.crosstab(df['gender'], df['decision'], margins=True)
female = dg.loc['female', 'All']
female_yes =  dg.loc['female', 'yes']
female_yes_pct = female_yes / female * 100
male = dg.loc['male', 'All']
male_yes =  dg.loc['male', 'yes']
male_yes_pct = male_yes / male * 100


fig = visual.count_plot(df, x='gender', hue='decision', title='Decisions by Gender')
fig.savefig("./reports/figures/decision_gender.png")
plt.close(fig)
```
![](../reports/figures/decision_gender.png)

`r kfigr::figr(label = "decisions_gender", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")`: Decisions by Gender

As indicated by `r kfigr::figr(label = "decisions_gender", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")` women were a bit more selective than men. Of the `r py$female` dates, women requested second dates `r round(py$female_yes_pct,0)`% of the time. Men requested second dates for `r round(py$male_yes_pct, 0)`% of their `r py$male` speed dates.

**#3) Mean age 26, with average of ~3.6 years age difference**
```{python age}
age = df[['age', 'd_age']]
quant = visual.describe_quant(age)
fig = visual.multi_histogram(age, nrows=1, ncols=2, title='Distribution of Age and Age Differences')
fig.savefig("./reports/figures/age.png")
plt.close(fig)
```
![](../reports/figures/age.png)
`r kfigr::figr(label = "age", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")`: Distribution of Age and Age Differences

`r kfigr::figr(label = "age_table", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Table")`: Distribution of Age and Age Differences
```{r age_table}
knitr::kable(py$quant) %>%  
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = T, position = "center")
```

According to `r kfigr::figr(label = "age", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")` and `r kfigr::figr(label = "age_table", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Table")`, participants ranged from age  `r py$quant$min[1]` to `r py$quant$max[1]`, with an interquartile range from `r round(py$quant[1,4],1)` to `r round(py$quant[1,7],1)` years of age. Age differences ranged from `r round(py$quant$min[2],0)` to `r round(py$quant$max[2],1)` years with a mean age difference of `r round(py$quant$mean[2],1)` years.

**#4) Attractive, sincere and funny**
```{python preferences}
pref = df[["attractive_important",	"sincere_important", "funny_important",
        "ambition_important", "shared_interests_important"]]
quant = visual.describe_quant(pref)
fig = visual.multi_boxplot(pref, nrows=1, ncols=5, ylim=100, horizontal=False, title='Preferences')
fig.savefig("./reports/figures/preferences.png")
plt.close(fig)
```
![](../reports/figures/preferences.png)

`r kfigr::figr(label = "preferences", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")`: Preferences

`r kfigr::figr(label = "preferences_table", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Table")`: Preference Statistics
```{r preferences_table}
knitr::kable(py$quant) %>%  
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = T, position = "center")
```
Participants were instructed to distribute 100 points among the five attributes, giving more points to the attributes that were more important in their decisions and fewer points to those attributes that were less important. The participants prioritized attractive over all other attributes.  Sincerity and a sense of humor followed. 


* * *
**#5)Male participants? Attraction. Female participants? Ambition and shared interests**
```{python preferences_by_gender}
pref = df[["gender", "attractive_important",	"sincere_important", "funny_important",
        "ambition_important", "shared_interests_important"]]
fig = visual.multi_boxplot(pref, groupby='gender', nrows=1, ncols=5, ylim=100, horizontal=False,
                           title='Preferences by Gender')
fig.savefig("./reports/figures/preferences_by_gender.png")
plt.close(fig)
```
![](../reports/figures/preferences_by_gender.png)
`r kfigr::figr(label = "preferences_gender", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")`: Preferences by Gender

As `r kfigr::figr(label = "preferences_gender", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")` reveals, the male participants prioritized the attractive attribute to a signficantly greater degree than did the female participants. On the other hand, the female participants placed greater weight on ambition and shared interests. There was less of a gender difference for the sincerity and humor attributes.

* * *
**#6) Above Average Sample (according to self-assessments)**
```{python self_assessments}
sa = df[["attractive", "sincere", "intelligence", "funny", "ambition"]]
quant = visual.describe_quant(sa)
fig = visual.multi_boxplot(sa, nrows=1, ncols=5, horizontal=False, title='Self-Assessments')
fig.savefig("./reports/figures/self_assessments.png")
plt.close(fig)
```
![](../reports/figures/self_assessments.png)

`r kfigr::figr(label = "self_assessments", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")`: Self-Assessments

`r kfigr::figr(label = "self_assessments_table", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Table")`: Self-Assessments
```{r self_assessment_table}
knitr::kable(py$quant) %>%  
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = T, position = "center")
```

Taking '5' as an average, our sample would most definitely be considered 'above average' in all five of the characteristics assessed in the study. According to `r kfigr::figr(label = "self_assessments", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")` and `r kfigr::figr(label = "self_assessments_table", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Table")`, this sample might be best characterized as sincerely funny!

* * *
**#7) Male participants had greater range of attractive and sincere attributes**
```{python self_assessments_by_gender}
sa = df[["gender", "attractive", "sincere", "intelligence", "funny", "ambition"]]
fig = visual.multi_boxplot(sa, groupby='gender', nrows=1, ncols=5, horizontal=False,
                           title='Self-Assessments by Gender')
fig.savefig("./reports/figures/self_assessments_by_gender.png")
plt.close(fig)
```
![](../reports/figures/self_assessments_by_gender.png)
`r kfigr::figr(label = "self_assessments_by_gender", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")`: Self-Assessments by Gender

Self-assessments of intelligence, humor and ambition were nearly identical between the genders as shown in `r kfigr::figr(label = "self_assessments_by_gender", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")`. On the other hand, there was a much greater dispersion for the attractive and sincere attributes among the male participants. That said, the differences in mean self-assessments, perhaps statistically significant, were practically equivalent.
