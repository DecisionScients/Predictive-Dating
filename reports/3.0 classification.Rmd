# Classification
Classification problems occur as much, if not more often, than regression problems. Examples include:  

* A credit card company receives thousands of new credit card applications which include annual salary, outstanding debts, age, profession, etc... On the basis of existing customer payment history and profile data, you wish to categorize applications as good credit risk, bad credit risk, or further review required.    

* A hand writing recognition application must ascertain, on the basis of labeled training data, the correct five digit ZIP code from a digitized hand written sample.

* An online match making service has tens of thousands of member profiles containing personal characteristics, preferences, goals, and historical matching data.  On the basis of this, you must develop an algorithm to predict whether two people are a good match.   

In binary classification problems, we can divide the predictor space into regions according to the classification. Linear methods of classification are used when these decision boundaries are linear.

## Learning Objectives
In this section, we will examine three popular methods for linear classification:
1. Logistic regression   
2. Linear discriminant analysis    
3. Quadratic discriminant analysis

By the close of this section you will
