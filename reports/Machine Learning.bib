abstract = {This paper presents a data set describing the sale of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. The data set contains 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous) involved in assessing home values. I will discuss my previous use of the Boston Housing Data Set and I will suggest methods for incorporating this new data set as a final project in an undergraduate regression course.},

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.},

@article{Brieman2001,
abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, * * * , 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Enough work has been done to verify the fact that a computer can be programmed so that it will learn to playa better game of checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the program. Further-more, it can learn to do this in a remarkably short period of time (8 or 10 hours of machine-playing time) when given only the rules of the game, a sense of direction, and a redundant and incomplete list of parameters which are thought to have something to do with the game, but whose correct signs and relative weights are unknown and unspecified. The principles of machine learning verified by these 'experiments are, of course, applicable to many other situations.},

abstract = {In this paper we perform an empirical evaluation of supervised learning on high-dimensional data. We evaluate performance on three metrics: accuracy, AUC, and squared loss and study the effect of increasing dimensionality on the performance of the learning algorithms. Our findings are consistent with previous studies for problems of relatively low dimension, but suggest that as dimensionality increases the relative performance of the learning algorithms changes. To our surprise, the method that performs consistently well across all dimensions is random forests, followed by neural nets, boosted trees, and SVMs.},
