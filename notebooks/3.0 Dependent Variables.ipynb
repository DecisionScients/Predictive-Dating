    "1. Decision - the decision of the subject or partner on the night of the event\n",
    "2. Match - occurs when both subject and partner choose a second date\n",
    "3. Yes Rate - the proportion of a subject's speed dates in the person was selected by his/her partner for second date\n",
    "4. Match Rate - the proportion of a subject's speed dates in the person was matched \n",
