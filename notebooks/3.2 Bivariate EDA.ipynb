    "#### Decision by Relative Sense of Humor\n",
    "This shows the decision by the subjects perception of their Sense of Humor vis-a-vis their perception of their partners Sense of Humor. This analysis shows a significant difference in decisions based upon the subject's perception of their Sense of Humor, relative to their perceptions of their partner's Sense of Humor. The means and medians were negative for both yes and no decisions, indicating that most participants considered their partners 'funnier' than themselves. Yes decisions were associated with slight differences; whereas, the no decisions were associated with subject's perceptions of their partner being 'too funny'. The difference was both statistically and practically significant.  The variance explained by the subject's perception of the difference in sense of humor wsa 14%."

This analysis shows a significant difference in decisions based upon the subject's perception of their Ambition, relative to their perceptions of their partner's Ambition. The mean and median difference was non-negative for the yes decisions suggesting that most of the yes decisions were for partners with equal or greater ambition. The practical significance is indicated by 1% variance explained."
